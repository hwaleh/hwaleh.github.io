# <u>About Me</u>

Hi, my name is Haaris Waleh. I am a Computer Scientist, and I recently graduated from UCSD. I am particularly interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), but I am also fascinated by Cybersecurity, Data Science, and Mathematics. I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make technology and innovations that can benefit others.

# <u>Projects</u>
Here are some of my recent projects. Please visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/hwaleh) for more.

## <u> Article Classifier: </u>
<b>Skills:</b> 
Python, sklearn, nltk, unsupervised learning, topic modeling, NLP, Pandas

<b>About:</b> 
Python script that uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to generate a topic modeler on a dataset of BBC articles to determine the main topic of each article in the dataset. This model can make predictions on user input files as well.
