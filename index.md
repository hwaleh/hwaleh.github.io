# <u>Experience</u>
Here is a quick overview of some of my work experience. Refer to my resume or LinkedIn for additional details. <br><br>

<u>Data Scientist, Business Analytics-</u>
<i> Freelance</i> <br>

<li>Collected data from various web sources and processed for use. 
</li>

<li>Performed demand forecasting using a variety of time series analysis methods including ARIMA and lstm models.</li>

<li>Performed ensemble learning for prediction using different data sets.</li>

<li>Created reports and met with executives to discuss results and plans. </li>
<br><br>

<u>Machine Learning Intern-</u>
<i> Bourbaki Group</i> <br>

<li>Collaborated with a team of interns to develop a machine learning tool that predicts the output of organic chemical equations based on line diagram inputs.</li>

<li>Researched state of the art models and performed transfer learning with these models to allow the tool to work with hand drawn and computer generated inputs.</li>

<li>This tool was able to accurately recognize organic chemical structures whether they were hand drawn or computer generated. </li>
<br><br>

<u>Software Develoment Intern-</u> 
<i> Creatorsoft</i> <br>

<li>Built an enterprise scale application for automating accounting. </li>

<li>Wrote middle tier code and performed testing of various components.</li>

# <u>Projects</u>
Here are some of my recent projects. Please visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/hwaleh) for more.

 <u> Real Time Text to Speech Translation App:</u> <br>
<b>Skills:</b> 
Python, React Native, transformers, LLM, deep learning, transfer learning, fine tuning

<b>About:</b> 
Simultaneously developing an Android and iOS app in React for real time text to speech translation. Translation will support multiple languages. App will be deployed, maintained, and updated as needed.

<br>
 
 <u> Article Classifier:</u> <br>
<b>Skills:</b> 
Python, sklearn, nltk, unsupervised learning, topic modeling, NLP, Pandas

<b>About:</b> 
Python script that uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to generate a topic modeler on a dataset of BBC articles to determine the main topic of each article in the dataset. This model can make predictions on user input files as well.

<br>

<u>Binary Image Segmenter:</u> <br>
<b>Skills:</b>
Python, PyTorch, U-Net, torchvision, Git

<b>About:</b> 
U-Net pipeline for model that performs binary image segmentation on portraits of people. As team lead, I also created guides for my peers and set project goals. End result was presented to peers and faculty.

Note: This project was conducted as part of a group project for the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) club at UCSD.

<br>

<u>Digit Classification Optimization:</u> <br>
<b>Skills:</b>
Python, Pytorch, TensorFlow, CNN, MLP, logistic regression

<b>About:</b>
Performed optimization of digit classification models on the MNIST dataset. This included writing logistic regression, MLP, and CNN models from scratch. Some models achieved 95%+ accuracy and saw training time reduced by up to 50% compared to baseline.
