# About Me

My name is **Haaris Waleh**. I am a 3rd year Computer Science Major at *UCSD*. 


## My Goals

As a ~~wise~~ progrqammer once said:

Though we may wish we could just `make clean` our mistakes to undo them, debugging is almost never that easy. However, as detailed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), that deosn't make fixing errors less important. It is my goal to fix any mistakes I make and not to make a mistake more than once.

Here are the general steps in debugging code:
1. Recognize the existence of a bug
2. Isolate the source
3. Identify the cause
4. Find a fix
5. Apply the fix and test 

Here is a list of famous programmers/ tech experts who I aspire to be like:
- Steve Jobs
- Bill Gates
- Linus Torvalds

Here is a list of topics in Artificial Intelligence, which is one of my areas of interest:

- Machine learning
    - Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
    - Reinforcement Machine learning algorithms
    - Deep learning
- Robotics
- Natural language processing
    - Speech recognition/ translation
    - Natural language generation
- And many more!
  
Here is yet another list with the steps to obtaining my degree as the Boy Scouts of America might list them:
- [x] Been there
- [x] Done that
- [ ] Got the patch
  
Lastly, here is a picture of me coding near the deadline for a project.
